# Frank-Wolfe Methods for Neural Network Training

**Author:** `Linus Filbry` — BSc Mathematics & BSc Computer Science, Technical University of Munich  
**Supervisor:** Prof. Michael Ulbrich  
**Year:** `2025`

This repository contains the implementation for my Bachelor’s Thesis. It explores Frank-Wolfe based optimization algorithms for weight-constrained neural networks, implements constraint-aware linear minimization oracles (LMOs) and weight initialization schemes, and provides scripts to reproduce all experiments and figures from the thesis.

## 📦 Features

- ✅ Frank-Wolfe and Modified Frank-Wolfe optimizers
- ✅ Weight Constraints and their LMOs and initialization schemes 
- ✅ Data-generation scripts for all thesis figures
- ✅ Visualization scripts to recreate all plots
- ✅ Pre-trained networks for fast reproduction
- ✅ Optional retraining from scratch

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LinusFilbry/BachelorThesis.git
cd BachelorThesis
```

### 2. Create environment & install dependencies
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Reproducing Thesis Experiments
To reproduce any experiment or figure from the thesis, run:
```bash
python main.py --action ACTION
```
where `ACTION` is one of:
- `figure_5.x` (with `x` ranging from 1 to 8) to generate the corresponding Figure 5.x from the thesis.
- `accuracy_SGD` to compute and report the accuracies of networks trained using SGD-based optimization methods.

## 📘 Notes on Reproducibility

- Pre-trained networks allow generating all figures quickly
- To retrain them, delete the corresponding files in networks/ and networks-SFW/
- Pre-trained networks are not used for figures 5.1 and 5.2, since they use accuracy values recorded during training
